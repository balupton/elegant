## Who am I / Why listen to me?

Professional web developer since 2006. JavaScript only since 2010.

## Why are we all here? / Why should you care?

- Producers, want to publish packages quicker with less overheads:
  - Spend less time in setup, and more time in editing
  - Keep tech updated without fearing breaking legacy and unknown environments

- Consumers, want to use packages quicker with more power:
  - Spend less time figuring out how to install packages, how they work, and how to use them
  - Have the power and ease to identify, debug and fix problems

## What are we covering? / What can I do with it?

1. Produce for...of that works for arrays and objects
  1. Create the directory
  2. `npm init`
  3. Create git repository
  4. Specify readme, license, package.json, index.js, .gitignore
  5. Specify other helper files - .editorconfig, HISTORY.md, etc
  6. Publish

2. CONSUME:

## How does it work? / What do I need to know?

## What if we do this? / Where can we take this?

## Caveats
